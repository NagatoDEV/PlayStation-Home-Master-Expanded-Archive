<title>PlayStation Home Announcement</title>
<description>PlayStation Home has been serving the PS3 community since December 2008. During that time, tens of millions of users around the world have grown the social gaming platform into a thriving community of creative and enthusiastic gamers.   

Due to a shifting landscape, PlayStation Home will cease publishing new content on the 12th of November, 2014. Gamers in SCEE territories will be able to download content until the 3rd of December, 2014. As a token of our tremendous gratitude to the community, we will also be releasing a series of free content prior to the platform's closure on the 31st of March, 2015.

We would like to thank all of our fans for their support of the PlayStation Home platform over the years.
