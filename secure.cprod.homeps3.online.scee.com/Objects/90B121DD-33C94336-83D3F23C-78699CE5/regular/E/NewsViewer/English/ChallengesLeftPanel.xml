<title>Challenges season 6 is here!</title>
<description>
The brand new season of Challenges begins this Wednesday, 6th August. Feast your eyes on the unique items we have waiting to join your inventory!

Pretend you're a super spy with an amazing retro audio reel. Or show everyone your medieval tastes with this classic sword and shield wall item. If pets aren't allowed in your apartment, you can adorn it with a self-contained ant farm and be mesmerised by how fast these little insects move. If bugs aren't your thing, there's a model racetrack to decorate your place. Perhaps you could place it in last season's Petrolhead Apartment!

For your avatar, we have some mad scientists visionators perfect if you enjoy a bit of eccentricity in your outfits! No outfit is complete without a companion, though, and the gorgeous black toucan will fly around your head and perch on your shoulder wherever you are. 

This season's apartment is a thing of modern beauty. Floor to ceiling windows give an exceptional view of an American-esque skyline and the twinkling river is the perfect place to lose yourself  when all you want is to relax. Each little detail of this apartment will surprise you and will make you wish you had one in real life!

So what are you waiting for? Get completing those challenges!
