<title>Welcome to PlayStation Home</title>
<description> 
1. And here we are. Sadly, this will be PlayStation®Home’s final update before its closure on March 31, 2015. We have one last batch of free items to share with you, and perhaps a surprise if you visit your Harbour Studio apartment. We at the Home team would like to thank each and every one of you for your support over the years. From explorers, to dancers, to gamers, to glitchers, you helped make Home the fun and rewarding experience that it was. To you, we convey our sincerest and most heartfelt “thank you.” We hope you enjoy the ride off into the sunset with Home.

2. All good things must come to an end, but not the Spotlight! The Spotlight series features the largest community cast in PlayStation®Home history. The greatest Home-filmed story ever told continues with more laughs, more tears and a storyline that never ends!
